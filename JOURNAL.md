## 9/8/2025 - Did some research  

Mostly spent time looking into how ZMK works as that is the firmware I will be using. As well as exploring keyboard matrices and skim reading the split wireless keyboard guide for some pointers. 

I don't intend to use the info from the guide much in the project, I was more using it for recommendations for microcontrollers.
