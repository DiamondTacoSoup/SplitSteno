## 11/8/2025 - Did some research  

Mostly spent time looking into how ZMK works as that is the firmware I will be using. As well as exploring keyboard matrices and skim reading the split wireless keyboard guide for some pointers. 

I don't intend to use the info from the guide much in the project, I was more using it for recommendations for microcontrollers.

## 11/9/2025 - Creating schematic and PCB  

The schematic was fairly simple, it was a near copy of the example from the split keyboard tutorial. The main modification was editing the Schematic fit the 22 key layout of a stenotype.

I chose an ortholinear layout for my keyboard, primarily so that I can fulfil my requirement of it being a rectangle. The thumb keys are offset by one row from the rest of the keys for ergonomic purposes. Other than that it was a simple matter of aligning the keys into two rows of 5 and one row of 2 and then creating all the traces.
