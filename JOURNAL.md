## 11/8/2025 - Did some research  

Mostly spent time looking into how ZMK works as that is the firmware I will be using. As well as exploring keyboard matrices and skim reading the split wireless keyboard guide for some pointers. 

I don't intend to use the info from the guide much in the project, I was more using it for recommendations for microcontrollers.

## 11/9/2025 - Creating schematic and PCB  

The schematic was fairly simple, it was a near copy of the example from the split keyboard tutorial. The main modification was editing the Schematic fit the 22 key layout of a stenotype.

I chose an ortholinear layout for my keyboard, primarily so that I can fulfil my requirement of it being a rectangle. The thumb keys are offset by one row from the rest of the keys for ergonomic purposes. Other than that it was a simple matter of aligning the keys into two rows of 5 and one row of 2 and then creating all the traces.

## 11/10/2025 - Started Creating the CAD file for the case  

It is a fairly standard rectangular design I am using for the case. 
The main feature the case adds is a wedged shaped angle stand that attaches to the stenotype via magnets. 
This wedge also doubles up as a protective case. The wedge can be attached to the top of the keyboard rather than the bottom using yet more magnets. The if the two sides of the case are put together the two wedges mesh, forming the two halves into a rectangular prism with the keys protected in the middle.

This design is not final, and I will be touching it up at a later date.
